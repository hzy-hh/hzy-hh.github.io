  I'm a sophomore at UESTC majoring in software engineering. I've joined the international elite program of our school and my average score is <strong>92.7</strong>(<strong>ranking:1/53</strong>)

  I've been learning machine/deep learning and its application in Data Mining and NLP(minor) since 2020-3.
